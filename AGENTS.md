# Repository Maintenance Instructions

The agent's primary role is to create prompts for YARA rule generation and to validate the rules generated by the pipeline.

When modifying code under this repository you must run the following commands before submitting a PR:

```
python -m py_compile *.py
python cli.py --help
python cli.py generate sample.json
```

The last command may fail if OpenAI credentials are invalid or network access is blocked. Include any such failure output in the PR notes.
